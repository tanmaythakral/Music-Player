# My Personal Project

## Music Player

**What will the application do?**

The application I've decided to make is a music player. This music player is able to load up songs from the songs directory
and then play/pause/resume the song. The user will also be able to change the song according to their own wish.
I plan to add a queue and a playlist system in the graphical version of the music player.

**Who will use it?**

Users can use it load up their own songs and play them. I believe anyone who wishes to play their songs can use it

**Why is this project of interest to you?**

Songs have been of personal interest of mine and I really like listening to songs. I believe that this project brings together
my interest with the Software construction which is very exciting.
